# jQuery AJAX & JSON

**Author**: Noah and Andrew
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
We utilized AJAX and Local Storage to load and save data.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
Set the fetch function to obtain the data from either local storage or AJAX. If theres no localstorage saved, then it will obtain it from AJAX. Once the data has been obtained from AJAX, it will save onto the local storage.


## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
Javascript/JQUERY- Used to fetch data from JSON file and save onto the localStorage, if there are no saved data on local storage.

AJAX - Used to fetch content when there are no saved data on the local storage. Once it's fetched, it saves onto the local storage.


## Change Log
<!-- Use this are to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:

0900am - read starter-code/ plan of action based on user stories
0930am - Started developing fetchAll function
1000am - Switched navigator - driver.
1030am - Researched the ways to utilize AJAX and local storage.
1100am - Identified the problem, and finished constructing our fetchall function with the help of TA.
